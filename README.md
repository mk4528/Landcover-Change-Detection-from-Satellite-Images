# Automatic landcover change detection

Project Objective - Establish a semantic segmentation model in a specific study area describing land cover change between two consecutive time points (such as
landcover in year 2022 vs. year 2017). Specifically, we wish to detect the loss or gain of “tree canopy” land cover class.
